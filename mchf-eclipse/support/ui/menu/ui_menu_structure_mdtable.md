AGC threshold should be placed/adjusted just above the band noise for every particular RX situation to allow for optimal AGC action. The blue AGC box indicates when AGC action takes place and helps in adjusting this threshold. | 
| **AGC WDSP Hang enable**      (                  MENU_AGC_WDSP_HANG_ENABLE) | Enable/Disable Hang AGC function: If enabled: after the signal has decreased, the gain of the AGC is held constant for a certain time period (the hang time) in order to allow for speech pauses without disturbing noise because of fast acting AGC. | 
| **AGC WDSP Hang time**        (                    MENU_AGC_WDSP_HANG_TIME) | Hang AGC: hang time is the time period over which the AGC gain is held constant when in AGC Hang mode. After this period the gain is increased fast. |

| **DSP NR Strength**           (                       MENU_DSP_NR_STRENGTH) | Set the Noise Reduction Strength. Higher values mean more agressive noise reduction but also higher CPU load. Use with extreme care. Also changeable using Encoder 2 if DSP is active. |

| **TX Initial Muting Time**    (              CONFIG_TXRX_SWITCH_AUDIO_MUTE) | When switching from RX to TX the audio and HF output will be muted for roughly VALUE ms. There are now several minimum times for muting defined in the firmware:<br/><br/> Input from Mic: 40ms<br/> Input from Line In: 40ms<br/> Digital Inputs (CW, USB): less than 1ms.<br/><br/> If the user defined 'TX Initial Muting Time' is set to more than zero, the maximum of both fixed input time and user defined time is used. Your microphone PTT switch is a potential source of noise if Mic is input! You need to increase the delay or change switches! |

| **XVTR Offset**               (               CONFIG_XVTR_FREQUENCY_OFFSET) | When transverter mode is enabled, this value is added to the mcHF frequency after being multiplied with the XVTR Offs/Mult. Use Step+ to set a good step width, much less turns with the dial knob if it is set to 1Mhz |

| **I2C2 Bus Speed**            (                          CONFIG_I2C2_SPEED) | Sets speed of the I2C2 bus (Audio Codec and I2C EEPROM).
