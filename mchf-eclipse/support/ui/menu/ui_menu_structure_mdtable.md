| **SAM PLL locking range**     (                 MENU_SAM_PLL_LOCKING_RANGE) | SAM PLL Locking Range in Hz: this determines how far up and down from the carrier frequency of an AM station we can offtune the receiver, so that the PLL will still lock to the carrier. | 
| **SAM PLL step response**     (                 MENU_SAM_PLL_STEP_RESPONSE) | Step response = Zeta = damping factor of the SAM PLL. Sets the stability and transient response of the PLL. Larger values give faster lock even if you are offtune, but PLL is also more sensitive. | 
| **SAM PLL bandwidth in Hz**   (                     MENU_SAM_PLL_BANDWIDTH) | Bandwidth of the PLL loop = OmegaN in Hz: smaller bandwidth = more stable lock.

If there is no QSB on the carrier, there is no change. |

AGC threshold should be placed/adjusted just above the band noise for every particular RX situation to allow for optimal AGC action. The blue AGC box indicates when AGC action takes place and helps in adjusting this threshold. | 
| **AGC Hang enable**           (                  MENU_AGC_WDSP_HANG_ENABLE) | Enable/Disable Hang AGC function: I enabled: after the signal has decreased, the gain of the AGC is held constant for a certain time period (the hang time) in order to allow for speech pauses without disturbing noise because of fast acting AGC. | 
| **AGC Hang time**             (                    MENU_AGC_WDSP_HANG_TIME) | Hang AGC: hang time is the time period over which the AGC gain is held constant when in AGC Hang mode. After this period the gain is increased fast. |

## Configuration Menu (`MENU_CONF`)
    
| LABEL                         (                                         NR) | DESCRIPTION                                    | 
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | 
| **Save Out-Of-Band Freq.**    (                CONFIG_FREQ_MEM_LIMIT_RELAX) | Select ON to save and restore frequencies which do not fit into the band during configuration saving (Power-Off or long press on Menu button) | 
| **TX on Out-Of-Band Freq.**   (                       CONFIG_TX_OUT_ENABLE) | Permit low power transmission even if the frequency is out of the official ham bands. DO NOT USE WITH CONNECTED ANTENNA! Use a dummy load! |

| **TX Initial Muting Time**    (              CONFIG_TXRX_SWITCH_AUDIO_MUTE) | When switching from RX to TX the audio and HF output will be muted for roughly VALUE ms. There are now several minimum times for muting defined in the firmware:<br/><br/> Input from Mic: 40ms<br/> Input from Line In: 40ms<br/> Digital Inputs (CW, USB): less than 1ms.<br/><br/> If the user defined 'TX Initial Muting Time' is set to more than zero, the maximum of both fixed input time and user defined time is used. Your microphone PTT switch is a potential source of noise if Mic is input! You need to increase the delay or change switches! | 
| **Max Volume**                (                          CONFIG_MAX_VOLUME) | Set maximum speaker&headphone volume.          |

The mcHF frequency is multiplied by this factor before the offset is added, so anything but 1 will result in each Hz in the mcHF being displayed as 2 to 10 Hz change on display. | 
| **XVTR Offset**               (               CONFIG_XVTR_FREQUENCY_OFFSET) | When transverter mode is enabled, this value is added to the mcHF frequency after being multiplied with the XVTR Offs/Mult. Use Step+ to set a good step width, much less turns with the dial knob if it is set to 1Mhz |

| **DSP Notch BufLen**          (CONFIG_DSP_NOTCH_DECORRELATOR_BUFFER_LENGTH) | DSP LMS automatic notch filter: length of the audio buffer that is used for simulation of a reference for the LMS algorithm. The longer the buffer, the better -and the slower- the performance, but this buffer length must always be larger than the number of taps in the FIR filter used.

| **Backup RAM Battery**        (                                  INFO_VBAT) | Battery Support for Backup RAM present?        | 
| **Real Time Clock**           (                                   INFO_RTC) | Battery Supported Real Time Clock present?     |

| LABEL                         (                                         NR) | DESCRIPTION                                    | 
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | 
| **TX Audio via USB**          (                        MENU_DEBUG_TX_AUDIO) | If enabled, send generated audio to PC during TX. | 
| **I2C1 Bus Speed**            (                      MENU_DEBUG_I2C1_SPEED) | Sets speed of the I2C1 bus (Si570 oscillator and MCP9801 temperature sensor). Higher speeds provide quicker RX/TX switching but may also cause tuning issues (red digits). Be careful with speeds above 200 kHz. Stored permanently. Will be moved to Configuration menu in future. | 
| **I2C2 Bus Speed**            (                      MENU_DEBUG_I2C2_SPEED) | Sets operation speed of the I2C2 bus (Audio Codec and I2C EEPROM). Higher speeds provide quicker RX/TX switching, configuration save and power off. Many mcHF seem to run with 400kHz without problems. Be careful with speeds above 100 kHz. Stored permanently. Will be moved to Configuration menu in future. | 
| **FT817 Clone Transmit**      (                        MENU_DEBUG_CLONEOUT) | Will in future send out memory a FT817 Clone Info (to be used with CHIRP). | 
| **FT817 Clone Receive**       (                         MENU_DEBUG_CLONEIN) | Will in future get memory data from a FT817 Clone Info (to be used with CHIRP). |
