20160103 [DF8OE]
- first release which supports future expansion pcbs for adding
1) RX 12KHz...80MHz, TX 160m, 6m and 4m
2) RX 80MHz...2000MHz, TX 2m, 70cm and 23cm
160m TX and RX is rudimentary supported without expansion board.
Filters for 80m are used. It works (not perfect at all) and you have
some small gaps at 160m where LO does not work. But a nice preview at all...
Of course will work much better with fitted expansion pcb ( I hope it will
be finished in the first 6 months of 2016)!!!
You can ge a preview how it looks if mcHF selects new bands if you touch
":" on touchscreen in menu #199 at recent lines (touching toggles pcb present
or not "hard-coded"). Of course frequency display is RED on any band < 160m or
> 10m because LO does not work out-of-the-box without needed expansion board(s)...

################## IMPORTANT INFORMATION ##################
Because of EEPROM addressing for band specific storage *must* be continuously
EEPROM structure (regardless virtual/serial) is broken with the adding of new
bands!!! If you take this version YOUR CONFIGURATON SETTINGS WILL BE LOST!!!
Please write down your actual configuration settings.

If this is the first firmware you install you have to do nothing special - only
upgrading from older versions are affected.

At first start after upgrading from older firmware version than
0.219.26.15 you must first reset all settings to default by press & hold
MENU-SPLIT-TUNE simultaneously while powering up and release after warning
screen appears. Then power down via power button  After startup enter all
configuration data you wrote down.

Good news at all:
If you take this new version and somedays pcbs are available there is no more
changing in EEPROM structure. Storage is organized for all possible new
bands regardless if they are active or not. This only consumpts ~40 Bytes of
virtual/serial EEPROM space and does not affect anything else.

20160102 [DF8OE]
- added autodetection of 7ppm SI570 devices using regs 13+


20151217 [DF8OE]
- added "working" state display for #341


20151215 [DF8OE]
- improved data accquisition of touchscreen, now hopefully more accurate
- solved "2.3khz filter issue"


20151214 [DF8OE]
- added "power off without saving settings" by pushing BAND+ and POWER simultanusly
- added possibility of power-off and reboot in button test mode


20151214 [DF8OE]
- added touchscreen support. You have to do the following modifications:

if LCD is in parallel mode:
remove R30, R31, R32
put connections between:
R30/R33 (PC2) to TP_SDO of LCD
R31/R34 (PC3) to TP_SDI of LCD
R32/R35 (PB13) to TP_SCK of LCD
Header Pin7 (PA4) to TP_IRQ of LCD
P8 Pin1 (PA9) to TP_CS of LCD

if LCD is in SPI mode:
same as above, but do not remove R30, R31, R32 (or wires if you use HY28B in SPI mode)

You can see signal names on back side of LCD. If you have soldered and cannot remove,
ask google for a picture of backside of HY28B - there are many.

With this mod you loose DAC which was former used for rf attenuator. This signal is
unused now and I supose it never will be used in future. Intermodulation while receiving
very strong signals can be removed by modifying rf preamp for better IP3.

After modifying and applying firmware newer/equal 0.219.26.13 in hardware menu #199
touchscreen is listed. When you enter BUTTON TEST MODE coordinates are shown if
you touch LCD screen. If this test is successful, you can use touchfunctions.

At the moment the following functions are supported:
- tapping right hand waterfall/scope bar: toggling wf/scope
- tapping left hand waterfall/scope bar: toggling wf/scope magnifying x 2
- tapping at a frequency/peak shown in wf/spectrum (lower part of the wf/scope) will tune to the tapped frequency

In future much more touch-functions will be added.


20151206 [DF8OE]
- added adjustment menu item #341 "Reset Ser EEPROM" to clean up misidentified EEPROM


20151206 [DF8OE]
- added menu item #197 "Backup Config to virtual EEPROM"
- added menu item #198 "Restore backup config to serial EEPROM"
Both items are only available i serial EEPROM is fitted. Now you can restore to
"working coniguration" if you have destroyed the acive one insteade of only
loading default values.


20151201 [DF8OE]
- added support for 24LC512 (64kb), 24LC1026 (128kb) and AT24CM02 (256kb). All these
can be be fitted to board without any additional changings (no wire between pin8 and
pin3 needed). Only if 24LC1025 is used this wire must be added.


20151130 [DF8OE]
- added detection of unsopported EEPROMs


20151126 [DF8OE]
- completed serial EEPROM support of 24LC1025
You have to add connection between pin8 and pin3 of 24LC1025
!!! 24LC01/02/04 are too small and config data cannot fit so that they are UNSUPPORTED !!!
At first start with fitted serial EEPROM and this (or newer) firmware serial EEPROM is
autodetected and then (if memory is big enough) virtual EEPROM is copied to serial
EEPROM. From now on all write functions are done with serial EEPROM and no longer
to virtual EEPROM. You can see if at menu item #199 serial EEPROM is written in
green letters. If so, it is in use. If it is in red letters, fitted serial EEPROM do
not have enough memory for storing settings.
It is important that EEPRM is brand-new or if not it is written 0xFF to all
cells before you solder it. Autodetection depends on a completely "empty" device!


20151115 [DF8OE]
- I named this back-rolled version for continuity to 0.219.26.6


20151111 [DF8OE]
- added menu "190" hardware-info
- beginning of EEPROM including (it is detected if present but not used in this version)

##################
20151111 Version 0.219.26.5  [KA7OEI]
- Fixed problem with 2.3k filter adjustment not being possible except in FM.
- Code cleanup to fix some warnings/function definitions.
##################
Comment DF8OE: 
I reverted this because of some heavy problems


20151103 Version 0.219.26.4  [KA7OEI]
- Increased size of 60 meters to accommodate some EU frequency useages
- Added function to reset frequencies/modes to default:  Press-and-hold F2 and F4 during power-up
- Added adjustment menu item "MemFreq Lim Disable".  When "ON", there are no limits imposed on
frequency bands that may be stored in each "band-memory" location.  WARNING:  This can cause bands to be
stored in random order and also make it easier to put different bands in VFO-A versus VFO-B which can
cause relay-switching/timing issues!


20151101 Version 0.219.26.3  [KA7OEI]
- Rewrote "AGC" handler for FM mode to reduce processing overhead when in FM.  The AGC does
not actually function in FM (there is no need for it!) but the value is calculated only to drive
the S-meter.  (In 0.219.26.0-2 the S meter did not work in FM.)


20151030 Version 0.219.26.2  [KA7OEI]
- Fixed problem with change detection of "Minor" version


20151029 Version 0.219.26.1  [KA7OEI]
- Fixed problem with key beep on/off
- Fixed TUNE in CW mode
- Added support for change detection of "Minor" version (e.g. "219", above)


10/28/2015 Version 0.0.219.26  [KA7OEI]
- Added "Load Defaults" obtained by holding F1, F3 AND F5 on power-up.  Once unit has
powered up, the user would DISCONNECT power to preserve the OLD settings or PRESS-AND-HOLD the
POWER button to save the new (default) settings to EEPROM and power down.  The unit halts on this
screen indefinitely.  Some defaults changes to be more useful.
- Added "button test" function where pressing-holding any button (other than power) during power-up will
display the button being being pressed (or the one with highest precedence if multiple) and the number
of buttons being pressed.
- Problem in which "PREV" and "NEXT" buttons on menu could skip last screen of "Configuration"
menu has been fixed.
- Fixed problem in which line under screen that indicates bandwidth/settings did not change under some
conditions (e.g. switching from one band to another where the same filter/settings were used, but
a different sideband was used).  Added "unconditional" update of this line when changing bands.
- Added "INVGray" and "Blue" waterfall palettes.
- Streamlined code related to DSP NR and Notch.
- Added keyboard beep.
- Completely rewrote AM demodulation to reduce CPU loading.
- Fixed problem (from 0.0.219.24) in which there were dead spots in Si570 tuning (incorrect FDCO Min/
max values).
- Added function where pressing-holding G3 will generate sidetone equivalent to CW offset, used for
"Spotting", in CW/LSB/USB modes/
- Added FM modulation/demodulation with squelch, subaudible tone encode/decode and tone burst.

- The following files have been added (I hope that I have them all here!):

  FILTERS:  iir_15k_hpf_fm_squelch.h   - Filter for squelch noise detection
            iir_2k7_tx_bpf_fm.h        - Filter for FM transmit audio

  AUDIO:    fm_dds_table.h             - DDS/NCO lookup table for FM/Subtone/Burst generation
            fm_subaudible_tone_table.h - List of subaudible tones for encode/decode


10/11/2015: Release of Version 219.24


10/10/2015 (KA7OEI)
- added "Load EEPROM default": Press-and-hold F1+F3+F5 on power-up, read and follow in-screen instructions
- bugfix "bandwidth indicator sometimes wrong when band was changed"


10/02/2015 (DF8OE)
- minor bugfixes in bootloader


09/30/2015 (DF8OE)
- creation aof new bootloader which allows firmware updates via USB-key


09/15/2015 (DF8OE)
- added autodetection of HY28A / HY28B in SPI mode (hardware changing needed --> see wiki on github pages


09/07/2015 (DF8OE)
- created makefile (thanks to DL4SAI)
- commented out of some curious lines which prevent building using makefile
- building is now possible with makefile but there is one issue to find:
  firmware binary is 600 bytes shorter than binary generated by eclipse and does only show splashscreen, then ends


08/19/2015 (DF8OE)
- added detection of SI570 hardware address (possible addresses 0x50 / 0x55)
- added workaround for malfunction of startupfrequency detection during unattended boots or bootloops
- merging Eclipse and CooCox configuration to one package so that both IDEs can be used


09/09/2015 (DF8OE)
- I merged Clint KA7OEI new released version 219.22. This new version now is named 219.23 and will be the base
for all future firmware developments - I hope...


09/08/2015 (DF8OE)
- makefile is now working


09/05/2015 (DF8OE)
- start: I used mcHF Firmware Source 219.19 from Clint KA7OEI as base of new mchf-firmware-community working with GITHUB
